I think this app is awesome and this whole program altogether! But I mostly use Dropbox for music and it gets kind of annoying that the music doesn&#39;t go in a playlist like in the music app. Can you change that?

I have loved and used Dropbox for a long time. I love the security of storing my most important documents online and the ability to access my content on all my devices. As far as the app goes, however, there are a few bugs that need to be worked out and some features that ought to be added. 

1. The app will often time fail to open a document and needs to be restarted before it will load. It will sometimes even freeze and crash. 

2. In order to open your files on a mobile device, you have to be connected to the internet. You can mark the files you choose as favorites and they can be viewed offline. But you have to mark every file individually, which is impractical because I have thousands of files in folders and subfolders. This wouldn&#39;t be so bad if the app let you make a FOLDER a favorite and all files it contained would automatically be saved onto the device for offline viewing. But such a simple feature is not present. There ought to be an option to have all documents saved on the device and updated via Internet connection (like the computer version). This would especially be good for people who use a mobile device as their primary device; all your content would be immediately available. 

3. If you want to reorganize your files or move documents, you have to do each one individually. Why can&#39;t I select multiple documents and move them together to another location? Once again, a simple feature to add. 

4. There is no option to rename a file or folder, which is an incredible nuisance.

Everybody ought to have this app. It is fantastic. However, there is significant room for improvement. Nonetheless I would recommend Dropbox hands down over and against any of its competitors. In terms of functionality and easy of use, there really is no competition.

Im on a crappy hotel wifi that goes in and out. Been trying to download a 1gb file for over 2 days now. But for some reason dropbox has not allowed favorited downloads the ability to resume  and instead restarts the download from the beginning every time it fails. It&#39;s almost 2014. We have the technology to RESUME A DOWNLOAD what&#39;s the problem here?

I miss the old version that had a real scrollbar that I could simply drag down instead of scrolling for miles trying to get where I want to be. And also, I miss when it would bookmark where I was in each document instead of refreshing every single time I exit the document - especially with the new scrollbar. I keep accidentally exiting the document and then I end up scrolling for 10 minutes to get to where I was

Since upgrading on my iPad I haven&#39;t been able to get into my Dropbox App. The iTunes popup repeatedly comes back up no matter how many times you press &#34;Ok&#34;. 

This also means it is impossible to link any newly installed apps to Dropbox as well.

I found a workaround as the only way to to get out of the app once it&#39;s stuck in this loop is to press the iPad sleep button, then swipe the camera as if to take a photo, and then press the home button. This takes you back to the home screen. Unfortunate this has to be done to begin with, PLEASE FIX!
